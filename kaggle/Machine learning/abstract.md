## First machine learning model

Tips for panda

```python

# Get panda columns
data.columns

#  -- Not a good practice --
# dropna drops missing values (think of na as "not available")
melbourne_data = melbourne_data.dropna(axis=0)


```

### Prediction target by convention is called Y.

```python

y = melbourne_data.Price
```

### Features by convention are called X

```python

melbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']

X = melbourne_data[melbourne_features]

```

## Building Your Model

Library: scikit-learn -> sklearn.

Steps to build a model:

1. Define:
   - What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
2. Fit:
   - Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling
3. Predict:
4. Evaluate:

```python

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Define model. Specify a number for random_state to ensure same results each run
#Many machine learning models allow some randomness in model training. Specifying a number for random_state ensures you get the same results in each run. This is considered a good practice. You use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.


melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(X, y)

```

## Model Validation

You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.

Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their training data and compare those predictions to the target values in the training data. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.

You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.

There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.

The prediction error for each house is:
```
error=actualâˆ’predicted
```

So, if a house cost $150,000 and you predicted it would cost $100,000 the error is $50,000.

With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as

- On average, our predictions are off by about X.


``` python
# Calculate MAE

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predicted_home_prices = melbourne_model.predict(X)
mean_absolute_error(y, predicted_home_prices)

```

### How to split train and test data.

The scikit-learn library has a function train_test_split to break up the data into two pieces. We'll use some of that data as training data to fit the model, and we'll use the other data as validation data to calculate mean_absolute_error.


``` python


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split data into training and validation data, for both features and target
# The split is based on a random number generator. Supplying a numeric value to
# the random_state argument guarantees we get the same split every time we
# run this script.
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0)
# Define model
melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# get predicted prices on validation data
val_predictions = melbourne_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, val_predictions))
It prints -> 258930.03550677857
# As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars. So the error in new data is about a quarter of the average home value.
```


# Underfitting and overfitting

scikit-learn docs: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html

Now that you have a reliable way to measure model accuracy, you can experiment with alternative models and see which gives the best predictions. But what alternatives do you have for models?

You can see in scikit-learn's documentation that the decision tree model has many options (more than you'll want or need for a long time). The most important options determine the tree's depth. Recall from the first lesson in this course that a tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction. This is a relatively shallow tree

In practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf. As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses. If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses. Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups. If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have  210  groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.

When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).

This is a phenomenon called overfitting, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.

At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called underfitting.

Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting. Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the figure below.

![OverUnderFitting](img/over_under_fitting.png)
        

We can use: max_leaf_nodes argument to controle max depth.

We can use a utility function to help compare MAE scores from different values for max_leaf_nodes:

``` python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

def get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)
    model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)
    return(mae)
```

And then use it.

``` python

# compare MAE with differing values of max_leaf_nodes
for max_leaf_nodes in [5, 50, 500, 5000]:
    my_mae = get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y)
    print("Max leaf nodes: %d  \t\t Mean Absolute Error:  %d" %(max_leaf_nodes, my_mae))

Max leaf nodes: 5  		 Mean Absolute Error:  347380
Max leaf nodes: 50  		 Mean Absolute Error:  258171
Max leaf nodes: 500  		 Mean Absolute Error:  243495
Max leaf nodes: 5000  		 Mean Absolute Error:  254983

## Of the options listed, 500 is the optimal number of leaves. Because min error ##

```


# Here's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:

- Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
- Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.

We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.



# Random Forests

Decision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.

Even today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. We'll look at the random forest as an example.

The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.

Example
You've already seen the code to load the data a few times. At the end of data-loading, we have the following variables:

/
We build a random forest model similarly to how we built a decision tree in scikit-learn - this time using the RandomForestRegressor class instead of DecisionTreeRegressor. /

``` python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
# 191669.7536453626

```

### Create different random forests and evaluate by mean absolute error

``` python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the models
model_1 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=0)
model_2 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
model_3 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, criterion='absolute_error', random_state=0)
model_4 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, min_samples_split=20, random_state=0)
model_5 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=7, random_state=0)

models = [model_1, model_2, model_3, model_4, model_5]

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Function for comparing different models
def score_model(model, X_t=X_train, X_v=X_valid, y_t=y_train, y_v=y_valid):
    model.fit(X_t, y_t)
    preds = model.predict(X_v)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_v, preds)

for i in range(0, len(models)):
    mae = score_model(models[i])
    print("Model %d MAE: %d" % (i+1, mae))

```


# Missing values

Using: [Melbourne Housing dataset](!https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot)

## Drop columns with missing values

Just drop every column with some null feature.

## Imputation

Fill missing values with some number, something like mean of that column.
This won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.

## Extension to imputation

In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.

In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.

![Extension to imputation](img/mv_extension_imputation.jpg)


## Validating MAE with different approaches

### Load data and train:

``` python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv')

# Select target
y = data.Price

# To keep things simple, we'll use only numerical predictors
melb_predictors = data.drop(['Price'], axis=1)
X = melb_predictors.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

# Divide data into training and validation subsets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

```

### Drop columns

``` python
# Get names of columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):")
print(score_dataset(reduced_X_train, reduced_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```

MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):
183550.22137772635

### Imputation

``` python

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train, imputed_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```
MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):
178166.46269899711


### An extension to imputation


``` python

# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

print("MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train_plus, imputed_X_valid_plus, y_train, y_valid))


``` 

MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):
178927.503183954

## Why did imputation perform better than dropping the columns?

The training data has 10864 rows and 12 columns, where three columns contain missing data. For each column, less than half of the entries are missing. Thus, dropping the columns removes a lot of useful information, and so it makes sense that imputation would perform better.

``` python

# Shape of training data (num_rows, num_columns)
print(X_train.shape)

# Number of missing values in each column of training data
missing_val_count_by_column = (X_train.isnull().sum())
print(missing_val_count_by_column[missing_val_count_by_column > 0])

```

# Categorical Variables

Is categorical when you have a limited number of options, example: "Never", "Rarely", "Most days", or "Every day".

Most machine learning models does not handle well strings so we must preprocess this first.

## Three aproaches

### Drop categorical variables

The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.

### Ordinal encoding
Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer.

![ordinal-encoding](./img/ordinal-encoding.png)

This approach assumes an ordering of the categories: "Never" (0) < "Rarely" (1) < "Most days" (2) < "Every day" (3).

This assumption makes sense in this example, because there is an indisputable ranking to the categories. Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as ordinal variables. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect ordinal encoding to work well with ordinal variables.


### One-hot encoding

One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data.

![one-hot-encoding](./img/one-hot-encoding.png)

In contrast to ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., "Red" is neither more nor less than "Yellow"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as nominal variables.

One-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values).


#### Validating with different approaches

Using [Melbourne Housing Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home) dataset.


If types in the dataset are already preprocessed you can do this to get a list of cateogrical variables.

``` python

s = (X_train.dtypes == 'object')
object_cols = list(s[s].index)

print("Categorical variables:")
print(object_cols)

```
##### Define Function to Measure Quality of Each Approach

We define a function score_dataset() to compare the three different approaches to dealing with categorical variables. This function reports the mean absolute error (MAE) from a random forest model. In general, we want the MAE to be as low as possible!

``` python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Function for comparing different approaches
def score_dataset(X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid):
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_valid)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)

```
#### Score from Approach 1 (Drop Categorical Variables)

We drop the object columns with the select_dtypes() method.

``` python
drop_X_train = X_train.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])
drop_X_valid = X_valid.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop categorical variables):")
print(score_dataset(drop_X_train, drop_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```
**MAE from Approach 1 (Drop categorical variables): 175703.48185157913**

#### Score from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding)
``` python

from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Make copy to avoid changing original data 
label_X_train = X_train.copy()
label_X_valid = X_valid.copy()

# Apply ordinal encoder to each column with categorical data
ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
label_X_train[object_cols] = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[object_cols])
label_X_valid[object_cols] = ordinal_encoder.transform(X_valid[object_cols])

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(label_X_train, label_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```

**MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding): 165936.40548390493**

#### Score from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding)

We use the OneHotEncoder class from scikit-learn to get one-hot encodings. There are a number of parameters that can be used to customize its behavior.

We set handle_unknown='ignore' to avoid errors when the validation data contains classes that aren't represented in the training data, and
setting sparse=False ensures that the encoded columns are returned as a numpy array (instead of a sparse matrix).
To use the encoder, we supply only the categorical columns that we want to be one-hot encoded. For instance, to encode the training data, we supply X_train[object_cols]. (object_cols in the code cell below is a list of the column names with categorical data, and so X_train[object_cols] contains all of the categorical data in the training set.)

``` python 

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Apply one-hot encoder to each column with categorical data
OH_encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
OH_cols_train = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[object_cols]))
OH_cols_valid = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.transform(X_valid[object_cols]))

# One-hot encoding removed index; put it back
OH_cols_train.index = X_train.index
OH_cols_valid.index = X_valid.index

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
num_X_train = X_train.drop(object_cols, axis=1)
num_X_valid = X_valid.drop(object_cols, axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_X_train = pd.concat([num_X_train, OH_cols_train], axis=1)
OH_X_valid = pd.concat([num_X_valid, OH_cols_valid], axis=1)

# Ensure all columns have string type
OH_X_train.columns = OH_X_train.columns.astype(str)
OH_X_valid.columns = OH_X_valid.columns.astype(str)

print("MAE from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(OH_X_train, OH_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```


**MAE from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding): 166089.4893009678**

### Which approach is best?
In this case, dropping the categorical columns (Approach 1) performed worst, since it had the highest MAE score. As for the other two approaches, since the returned MAE scores are so close in value, there doesn't appear to be any meaningful benefit to one over the other.

In general, one-hot encoding (Approach 3) will typically perform best, and dropping the categorical columns (Approach 1) typically performs worst, but it varies on a case-by-case basis.

### Doing actual practice with categorical variables.

Using [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) dataset.

If you want to see for a certain column if values are the same in training and validation dataset you can do this.

``` python

print("Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data:", X_train['Condition2'].unique())
print("\nUnique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data:", X_valid['Condition2'].unique())

```

- Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data: ['Norm' 'PosA' 'Feedr' 'PosN' 'Artery' 'RRAe']

- Unique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data: ['Norm' 'RRAn' 'RRNn' 'Artery' 'Feedr' 'PosN']

### Problems with this and ordinal encoding

Fitting an ordinal encoder to a column in the training data creates a corresponding integer-valued label for each unique value that appears in the training data. In the case that the validation data contains values that don't also appear in the training data, the encoder will throw an error, because these values won't have an integer assigned to them. Notice that the 'Condition2' column in the validation data contains the values 'RRAn' and 'RRNn', but these don't appear in the training data -- thus, if we try to use an ordinal encoder with scikit-learn, the code will throw an error.

#### Posible solution:

This is a common problem that you'll encounter with real-world data, and there are many approaches to fixing this issue.  For instance, you can write a custom ordinal encoder to deal with new categories.  The simplest approach, however, is to drop the problematic categorical columns.  

Run the code cell below to save the problematic columns to a Python list `bad_label_cols`.  Likewise, columns that can be safely ordinal encoded are stored in `good_label_cols`.

``` python

# Categorical columns in the training data
object_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if X_train[col].dtype == "object"]

# Columns that can be safely ordinal encoded
good_label_cols = [col for col in object_cols if 
                   set(X_valid[col]).issubset(set(X_train[col]))]
        
# Problematic columns that will be dropped from the dataset
bad_label_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(good_label_cols))
        
print('Categorical columns that will be ordinal encoded:', good_label_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', bad_label_cols)

```

- Categorical columns that will be ordinal encoded: ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'LotShape', 'LandContour', 'Utilities', 'LotConfig', 'LandSlope', 'Neighborhood', 'Condition1', 'BldgType', 'HouseStyle', 'RoofStyle', 'Exterior1st', 'Exterior2nd', 'ExterQual', 'ExterCond', 'Foundation', 'Heating', 'HeatingQC', 'CentralAir', 'KitchenQual', 'PavedDrive', 'SaleType', 'SaleCondition']

- Categorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset: ['Functional', 'RoofMatl', 'Condition2']

#### Ordinal encoding

``` python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Drop categorical columns that will not be encoded
label_X_train = X_train.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)
label_X_valid = X_valid.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)

# Apply ordinal encoder 
ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
label_X_train[good_label_cols] = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[good_label_cols])
label_X_valid[good_label_cols] = ordinal_encoder.transform(X_valid[good_label_cols])

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(label_X_train, label_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```

**MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding): 17098.01649543379**

#### Get number of unique entries in each column with categorical data

``` python

object_nunique = list(map(lambda col: X_train[col].nunique(), object_cols))
d = dict(zip(object_cols, object_nunique))

# Print number of unique entries by column, in ascending order
sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

```


### What variables can be hot encoded:

With less than 15-10 unique values.

``` python 
# Columns that will be one-hot encoded
low_cardinality_cols = [col for col in object_cols if X_train[col].nunique() < 10]

# Columns that will be dropped from the dataset
high_cardinality_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(low_cardinality_cols))

print('Categorical columns that will be one-hot encoded:', low_cardinality_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', high_cardinality_cols)
```

- Hot encoding:

``` python

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Use as many lines of code as you need!

OH_encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
OH_cols_train = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[low_cardinality_cols]))
OH_cols_valid = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.transform(X_valid[low_cardinality_cols]))

# One-hot encoding removed index; put it back
OH_cols_train.index = X_train.index
OH_cols_valid.index = X_valid.index

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
num_X_train = X_train.drop(object_cols, axis=1)
num_X_valid = X_valid.drop(object_cols, axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_X_train = pd.concat([num_X_train, OH_cols_train], axis=1)
OH_X_valid = pd.concat([num_X_valid, OH_cols_valid], axis=1)

# Ensure all columns have string type
OH_X_train.columns = OH_X_train.columns.astype(str)
OH_X_valid.columns = OH_X_valid.columns.astype(str)

```


# Pipelines

Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.

## Example
As in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home).

We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in X_train, X_valid, y_train, and y_valid.

### Step 1: Define Preprocessing Steps

Similar to how a pipeline bundles together preprocessing and modeling steps, we use the ColumnTransformer class to bundle together different preprocessing steps. The code below:

- imputes missing values in numerical dat
- imputes missing values and applies a one-hot encoding to categorical data.

``` python
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Preprocessing for numerical data
numerical_transformer = SimpleImputer(strategy='constant')

# Preprocessing for categorical data
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols)
    ])

```

### Step 2: Define the Model

Next, we define a random forest model with the familiar RandomForestRegressor class.


``` python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
```

### Step 3: Create and Evaluate the Pipeline

Finally, we use the Pipeline class to define a pipeline that bundles the preprocessing and modeling steps. There are a few important things to notice:

With the pipeline, we preprocess the training data and fit the model in a single line of code. (In contrast, without a pipeline, we have to do imputation, one-hot encoding, and model training in separate steps. This becomes especially messy if we have to deal with both numerical and categorical variables!)
With the pipeline, we supply the unprocessed features in X_valid to the predict() command, and the pipeline automatically preprocesses the features before generating predictions. (However, without a pipeline, we have to remember to preprocess the validation data before making predictions.)


``` python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Bundle preprocessing and modeling code in a pipeline
my_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                              ('model', model)
                             ])

# Preprocessing of training data, fit model 
my_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Preprocessing of validation data, get predictions
preds = my_pipeline.predict(X_valid)

# Evaluate the model
score = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)
print('MAE:', score)

```
## Conclusion

Pipelines are valuable for cleaning up machine learning code and avoiding errors, and are especially useful for workflows with sophisticated data preprocessing.


# Cross-Validation

You will face choices about what predictive variables to use, what types of models to use, what arguments to supply to those models, etc. So far, you have made these choices in a data-driven way by measuring model quality with a validation (or holdout) set.

But there are some drawbacks to this approach. To see this, imagine you have a dataset with 5000 rows. You will typically keep about 20% of the data as a validation dataset, or 1000 rows. But this leaves some random chance in determining model scores. That is, a model might do well on one set of 1000 rows, even if it would be inaccurate on a different 1000 rows.

At an extreme, you could imagine having only 1 row of data in the validation set. If you compare alternative models, which one makes the best predictions on a single data point will be mostly a matter of luck!

In general, the larger the validation set, the less randomness (aka "noise") there is in our measure of model quality, and the more reliable it will be. Unfortunately, we can only get a large validation set by removing rows from our training data, and smaller training datasets mean worse models!

In cross-validation, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.

For example, we could begin by dividing the data into 5 pieces, each 20% of the full dataset. In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 "folds".

![Cross validation](./img/cross-validation.png)


Then, we run one experiment for each fold:

- In Experiment 1, we use the first fold as a validation (or holdout) set and everything else as training data. This gives us a measure of model quality based on a 20% holdout set.
- In Experiment 2, we hold out data from the second fold (and use everything except the second fold for training the model). The holdout set is then used to get a second estimate of model quality.
- We repeat this process, using every fold once as the holdout set. Putting this together, 100% of the data is used as holdout at some point, and we end up with a measure of model quality that is based on all of the rows in the dataset (even if we don't use all rows simultaneously).


### When should you use cross-validation?

Cross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take longer to run, because it estimates multiple models (one for each fold).

So, given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach?

- For small datasets, where extra computational burden isn't a big deal, you should run cross-validation.
- For larger datasets, a single validation set is sufficient. Your code will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout.
There's no simple threshold for what constitutes a large vs. small dataset. But if your model takes a couple minutes or less to run, it's probably worth switching to cross-validation.

Alternatively, you can run cross-validation and see if the scores for each experiment seem close. If each experiment yields the same results, a single validation set is probably sufficient.

### Example

We'll work with the same data as in the previous tutorial. We load the input data in X and the output data in y.

Then, we define a pipeline that uses an imputer to fill in missing values and a random forest model to make predictions.

While it's possible to do cross-validation without pipelines, it is quite difficult! Using a pipeline will make the code remarkably straightforward.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

my_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', SimpleImputer()),
                              ('model', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50,
                                                              random_state=0))
                             ])
```

We obtain the cross-validation scores with the cross_val_score() function from scikit-learn. We set the number of folds with the cv parameter.

```python

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Multiply by -1 since sklearn calculates *negative* MAE
scores = -1 * cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y,
                              cv=5,
                              scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')

print("MAE scores:\n", scores)

```

```
MAE scores:
 [301628.7893587  303164.4782723  287298.331666   236061.84754543
 260383.45111427]
```

The scoring parameter chooses a measure of model quality to report: in this case, we chose negative mean absolute error (MAE). The docs for scikit-learn show a list of options.

It is a little surprising that we specify negative MAE. Scikit-learn has a convention where all metrics are defined so a high number is better. Using negatives here allows them to be consistent with that convention, though negative MAE is almost unheard of elsewhere.

We typically want a single measure of model quality to compare alternative models. So we take the average across experiments.

```python
print("Average MAE score (across experiments):")
print(scores.mean())
```
```
Average MAE score (across experiments):
277707.3795913405
```

### Conclusion

Using cross-validation yields a much better measure of model quality, with the added benefit of cleaning up our code: note that we no longer need to keep track of separate training and validation sets. So, especially for small datasets, it's a good improvement!

# XGBoost

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build and optimize models with gradient boosting. This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.

Gradient boosting is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.

It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)

Then, we start the cycle:

- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.
- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).
Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The "gradient" in "gradient boosting" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)
- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...
- ... repeat!

![Gradient boosting](./img/gradient-boosting.png)

### Example

We begin by loading the training and validation data in X_train, X_valid, y_train, and y_valid.

In this example, you'll work with the XGBoost library. XGBoost stands for extreme gradient boosting, which is an implementation of gradient boosting with several additional features focused on performance and speed. (Scikit-learn has another version of gradient boosting, but XGBoost has some technical advantages.)

In the next code cell, we import the scikit-learn API for XGBoost (xgboost.XGBRegressor). This allows us to build and fit a model just as we would in scikit-learn. As you'll see in the output, the XGBRegressor class has many tunable parameters -- you'll learn about those soon!

``` python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

my_model = XGBRegressor()
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
We also make predictions and evaluate the model.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predictions = my_model.predict(X_valid)
print("Mean Absolute Error: " + str(mean_absolute_error(predictions, y_valid)))
```
```
Mean Absolute Error: 241041.5160392121
```

## Parameter Tuning

XGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed. The first parameters you should understand are:

n_estimators
n_estimators specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above. It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.

Too low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both training data and test data.
Too high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data, but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about).
Typical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the learning_rate parameter discussed below.

Here is the code to set the number of models in the ensemble:

```python
my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**early_stopping_rounds**

early_stopping_rounds offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.

Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.

When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.

We can modify the example above to include early stopping:

```python
my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500, early_stopping_rounds=5)
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)],
             verbose=False)
```

If you later want to fit a model with all of your data, set n_estimators to whatever value you found to be optimal when run with early stopping.

learning_rate
Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.

This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.

In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1.

Modifying the example above to change the learning rate yields the following code:



``` python
my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05)
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
             early_stopping_rounds=5, 
             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)], 
             verbose=False)

```

**n_jobs**

On larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, you can use parallelism to build your models faster. It's common to set the parameter n_jobs equal to the number of cores on your machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.

The resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where you would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the fit command.

Here's the modified example:

``` python
my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05, n_jobs=4)
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
             early_stopping_rounds=5, 
             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)], 
             verbose=False)
```

### Conclusion

XGBoost is a leading software library for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos). With careful parameter tuning, you can train highly accurate models.


# Data Leakage

Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.

In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.

There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.

## Target leakage

Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.

An example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data look like this:

![target-leakage-1](./img/target-leakage-1.png)

People take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but took_antibiotic_medicine is frequently changed after the value for got_pneumonia is determined. This is target leakage.

The model would see that anyone who has a value of False for took_antibiotic_medicine didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.

But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.

To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.

## Train-Test Contamination

A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.

Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination.

For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split(). The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.

After all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.

If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!

### Example

In this example, you will learn one way to detect and remove target leakage.

We will use a dataset about credit card applications and skip the basic data set-up code. The end result is that information about each credit card application is stored in a DataFrame X. We'll use it to predict which applications were accepted in a Series y.

Number of rows in the dataset: 1319

![Data leakage](./img/data-leakage.png)

Since this is a small dataset, we will use cross-validation to ensure accurate measures of model quality.


``` python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Since there is no preprocessing, we don't need a pipeline (used anyway as best practice!)
my_pipeline = make_pipeline(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100))
cv_scores = cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y, 
                            cv=5,
                            scoring='accuracy')

print("Cross-validation accuracy: %f" % cv_scores.mean())
```
```
Cross-validation accuracy: 0.981052
```


With experience, you'll find that it's very rare to find models that are accurate 98% of the time. It happens, but it's uncommon enough that we should inspect the data more closely for target leakage.

Here is a summary of the data, which you can also find under the data tab:

- **card**: 1 if credit card application accepted, 0 if not
- **reports**: Number of major derogatory reports
- **age**: Age n years plus twelfths of a year
- **income**: Yearly income (divided by 10,000)
- **share**: Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income
- **expenditure**: Average monthly credit card expenditure
- **owner**: 1 if owns home, 0 if rents
- **selfempl**: 1 if self-employed, 0 if not
- **dependents**: 1 + number of dependents
- **months**: Months living at current address
- **majorcards**: Number of major credit cards held
- **active**: Number of active credit accounts
A few variables look suspicious. For example, does expenditure mean expenditure on this card or on cards used before applying?

At this point, basic data comparisons can be very helpful:


```python
expenditures_cardholders = X.expenditure[y]
expenditures_noncardholders = X.expenditure[~y]

print('Fraction of those who did not receive a card and had no expenditures: %.2f' \
      %((expenditures_noncardholders == 0).mean()))
print('Fraction of those who received a card and had no expenditures: %.2f' \
      %(( expenditures_cardholders == 0).mean()))
```
```
Fraction of those who did not receive a card and had no expenditures: 1.00
Fraction of those who received a card and had no expenditures: 0.02
```
As shown above, everyone who did not receive a card had no expenditures, while only 2% of those who received a card had no expenditures. It's not surprising that our model appeared to have a high accuracy. But this also seems to be a case of target leakage, where expenditures probably means expenditures on the card they applied for.

Since share is partially determined by expenditure, it should be excluded too. The variables active and majorcards are a little less clear, but from the description, they sound concerning. In most situations, it's better to be safe than sorry if you can't track down the people who created the data to find out more.

We would run a model without target leakage as follows:
```
# Drop leaky predictors from dataset
potential_leaks = ['expenditure', 'share', 'active', 'majorcards']
X2 = X.drop(potential_leaks, axis=1)

# Evaluate the model with leaky predictors removed
cv_scores = cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X2, y, 
                            cv=5,
                            scoring='accuracy')

print("Cross-val accuracy: %f" % cv_scores.mean())
```
This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which might be disappointing. However, we can expect it to be right about 80% of the time when used on new applications, whereas the leaky model would likely do much worse than that (in spite of its higher apparent score in cross-validation).

## Conclusion
Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.
