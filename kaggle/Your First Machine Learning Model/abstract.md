# Your First Machine Learning Model

Tips for panda

```python

# Get panda columns
data.columns

#  -- Not a good practice --
# dropna drops missing values (think of na as "not available")
melbourne_data = melbourne_data.dropna(axis=0)


```

### Prediction target by convention is called Y.

```python

y = melbourne_data.Price
```

### Features by convention are called X

```python

melbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']

X = melbourne_data[melbourne_features]

```

## Building Your Model

Library: scikit-learn -> sklearn.

Steps to build a model:

1. Define:
   - What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
2. Fit:
   - Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling
3. Predict:
4. Evaluate:

```python

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Define model. Specify a number for random_state to ensure same results each run
#Many machine learning models allow some randomness in model training. Specifying a number for random_state ensures you get the same results in each run. This is considered a good practice. You use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.


melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(X, y)

```

## Model Validation

You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.

Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their training data and compare those predictions to the target values in the training data. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.

You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.

There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.

The prediction error for each house is:
```
error=actualâˆ’predicted
```

So, if a house cost $150,000 and you predicted it would cost $100,000 the error is $50,000.

With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as

- On average, our predictions are off by about X.


``` python
# Calculate MAE

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predicted_home_prices = melbourne_model.predict(X)
mean_absolute_error(y, predicted_home_prices)

```

### How to split train and test data.

The scikit-learn library has a function train_test_split to break up the data into two pieces. We'll use some of that data as training data to fit the model, and we'll use the other data as validation data to calculate mean_absolute_error.


``` python


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split data into training and validation data, for both features and target
# The split is based on a random number generator. Supplying a numeric value to
# the random_state argument guarantees we get the same split every time we
# run this script.
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0)
# Define model
melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# get predicted prices on validation data
val_predictions = melbourne_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, val_predictions))
It prints -> 258930.03550677857
# As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars. So the error in new data is about a quarter of the average home value.
```


# Underfitting and overfitting

scikit-learn docs: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html

Now that you have a reliable way to measure model accuracy, you can experiment with alternative models and see which gives the best predictions. But what alternatives do you have for models?

You can see in scikit-learn's documentation that the decision tree model has many options (more than you'll want or need for a long time). The most important options determine the tree's depth. Recall from the first lesson in this course that a tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction. This is a relatively shallow tree

In practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf. As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses. If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses. Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups. If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have  210  groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.

When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).

This is a phenomenon called overfitting, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.

At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called underfitting.

Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting. Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the figure below.

![OverUnderFitting](img/over_under_fitting.png)
        

We can use: max_leaf_nodes argument to controle max depth.

We can use a utility function to help compare MAE scores from different values for max_leaf_nodes:

``` python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

def get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)
    model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)
    return(mae)
```

And then use it.

``` python

# compare MAE with differing values of max_leaf_nodes
for max_leaf_nodes in [5, 50, 500, 5000]:
    my_mae = get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y)
    print("Max leaf nodes: %d  \t\t Mean Absolute Error:  %d" %(max_leaf_nodes, my_mae))

Max leaf nodes: 5  		 Mean Absolute Error:  347380
Max leaf nodes: 50  		 Mean Absolute Error:  258171
Max leaf nodes: 500  		 Mean Absolute Error:  243495
Max leaf nodes: 5000  		 Mean Absolute Error:  254983

## Of the options listed, 500 is the optimal number of leaves. Because min error ##

```


# Here's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:

- Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
- Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.

We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.



# Random Forests

Decision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.

Even today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. We'll look at the random forest as an example.

The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.

Example
You've already seen the code to load the data a few times. At the end of data-loading, we have the following variables:

/
We build a random forest model similarly to how we built a decision tree in scikit-learn - this time using the RandomForestRegressor class instead of DecisionTreeRegressor. /

``` python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
