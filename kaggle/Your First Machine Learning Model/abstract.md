# Your First Machine Learning Model

Tips for panda

```python

# Get panda columns
data.columns

#  -- Not a good practice --
# dropna drops missing values (think of na as "not available")
melbourne_data = melbourne_data.dropna(axis=0)


```

### Prediction target by convention is called Y.

```python

y = melbourne_data.Price
```

### Features by convention are called X

```python

melbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']

X = melbourne_data[melbourne_features]

```

## Building Your Model

Library: scikit-learn -> sklearn.

Steps to build a model:

1. Define:
   - What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
2. Fit:
   - Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling
3. Predict:
4. Evaluate:

```python

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Define model. Specify a number for random_state to ensure same results each run
#Many machine learning models allow some randomness in model training. Specifying a number for random_state ensures you get the same results in each run. This is considered a good practice. You use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.


melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(X, y)

```

## Model Validation

You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.

Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their training data and compare those predictions to the target values in the training data. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.

You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.

There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.

The prediction error for each house is:
```
error=actualâˆ’predicted
```

So, if a house cost $150,000 and you predicted it would cost $100,000 the error is $50,000.

With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as

- On average, our predictions are off by about X.


``` python
# Calculate MAE

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predicted_home_prices = melbourne_model.predict(X)
mean_absolute_error(y, predicted_home_prices)

```

### How to split train and test data.

The scikit-learn library has a function train_test_split to break up the data into two pieces. We'll use some of that data as training data to fit the model, and we'll use the other data as validation data to calculate mean_absolute_error.


``` python


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split data into training and validation data, for both features and target
# The split is based on a random number generator. Supplying a numeric value to
# the random_state argument guarantees we get the same split every time we
# run this script.
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0)
# Define model
melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# get predicted prices on validation data
val_predictions = melbourne_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, val_predictions))
It prints -> 258930.03550677857
# As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars. So the error in new data is about a quarter of the average home value.
```


# Underfitting and overfitting

scikit-learn docs: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html

Now that you have a reliable way to measure model accuracy, you can experiment with alternative models and see which gives the best predictions. But what alternatives do you have for models?

You can see in scikit-learn's documentation that the decision tree model has many options (more than you'll want or need for a long time). The most important options determine the tree's depth. Recall from the first lesson in this course that a tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction. This is a relatively shallow tree

In practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf. As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses. If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses. Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups. If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have  210  groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.

When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).

This is a phenomenon called overfitting, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.

At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called underfitting.

Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting. Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the figure below.

![OverUnderFitting](img/over_under_fitting.png)
        

We can use: max_leaf_nodes argument to controle max depth.

We can use a utility function to help compare MAE scores from different values for max_leaf_nodes:

``` python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

def get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)
    model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)
    return(mae)
```

And then use it.

``` python

# compare MAE with differing values of max_leaf_nodes
for max_leaf_nodes in [5, 50, 500, 5000]:
    my_mae = get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y)
    print("Max leaf nodes: %d  \t\t Mean Absolute Error:  %d" %(max_leaf_nodes, my_mae))

Max leaf nodes: 5  		 Mean Absolute Error:  347380
Max leaf nodes: 50  		 Mean Absolute Error:  258171
Max leaf nodes: 500  		 Mean Absolute Error:  243495
Max leaf nodes: 5000  		 Mean Absolute Error:  254983

## Of the options listed, 500 is the optimal number of leaves. Because min error ##

```


# Here's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:

- Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
- Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.

We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.



# Random Forests

Decision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.

Even today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. We'll look at the random forest as an example.

The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.

Example
You've already seen the code to load the data a few times. At the end of data-loading, we have the following variables:

/
We build a random forest model similarly to how we built a decision tree in scikit-learn - this time using the RandomForestRegressor class instead of DecisionTreeRegressor. /

``` python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
# 191669.7536453626

```

### Create different random forests and evaluate by mean absolute error

``` python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the models
model_1 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=0)
model_2 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
model_3 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, criterion='absolute_error', random_state=0)
model_4 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, min_samples_split=20, random_state=0)
model_5 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=7, random_state=0)

models = [model_1, model_2, model_3, model_4, model_5]

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Function for comparing different models
def score_model(model, X_t=X_train, X_v=X_valid, y_t=y_train, y_v=y_valid):
    model.fit(X_t, y_t)
    preds = model.predict(X_v)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_v, preds)

for i in range(0, len(models)):
    mae = score_model(models[i])
    print("Model %d MAE: %d" % (i+1, mae))

```


# Missing values

Using: [Melbourne Housing dataset](!https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot)

## Drop columns with missing values

Just drop every column with some null feature.

## Imputation

Fill missing values with some number, something like mean of that column.
This won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.

## Extension to imputation

In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.

In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.

![Extension to imputation](img/mv_extension_imputation.jpg)


## Validating MAE with different approaches

### Load data and train:

``` python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv')

# Select target
y = data.Price

# To keep things simple, we'll use only numerical predictors
melb_predictors = data.drop(['Price'], axis=1)
X = melb_predictors.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

# Divide data into training and validation subsets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

```

### Drop columns

``` python
# Get names of columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):")
print(score_dataset(reduced_X_train, reduced_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```

MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):
183550.22137772635

### Imputation

``` python

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train, imputed_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```
MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):
178166.46269899711


### An extension to imputation


``` python

# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

print("MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train_plus, imputed_X_valid_plus, y_train, y_valid))


``` 

MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):
178927.503183954

## Why did imputation perform better than dropping the columns?

The training data has 10864 rows and 12 columns, where three columns contain missing data. For each column, less than half of the entries are missing. Thus, dropping the columns removes a lot of useful information, and so it makes sense that imputation would perform better.

``` python

# Shape of training data (num_rows, num_columns)
print(X_train.shape)

# Number of missing values in each column of training data
missing_val_count_by_column = (X_train.isnull().sum())
print(missing_val_count_by_column[missing_val_count_by_column > 0])

```

# Categorical Variables

Is categorical when you have a limited number of options, example: "Never", "Rarely", "Most days", or "Every day".

Most machine learning models does not handle well strings so we must preprocess this first.

## Three aproaches

### Drop categorical variables

The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.

### Ordinal encoding
Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer.

![ordinal-encoding](../../abstract-images/ordinal-encoding.png)

This approach assumes an ordering of the categories: "Never" (0) < "Rarely" (1) < "Most days" (2) < "Every day" (3).

This assumption makes sense in this example, because there is an indisputable ranking to the categories. Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as ordinal variables. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect ordinal encoding to work well with ordinal variables.


### One-hot encoding

One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data.

![one-hot-encoding](../../abstract-images/one-hot-encoding.png)

In contrast to ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., "Red" is neither more nor less than "Yellow"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as nominal variables.

One-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values).


#### Validating with different approaches

Using [Melbourne Housing Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home) dataset.


If types in the dataset are already preprocessed you can do this to get a list of cateogrical variables.

``` python

s = (X_train.dtypes == 'object')
object_cols = list(s[s].index)

print("Categorical variables:")
print(object_cols)

```
##### Define Function to Measure Quality of Each Approach

We define a function score_dataset() to compare the three different approaches to dealing with categorical variables. This function reports the mean absolute error (MAE) from a random forest model. In general, we want the MAE to be as low as possible!

``` python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Function for comparing different approaches
def score_dataset(X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid):
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_valid)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)

```
#### Score from Approach 1 (Drop Categorical Variables)

We drop the object columns with the select_dtypes() method.

``` python
drop_X_train = X_train.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])
drop_X_valid = X_valid.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop categorical variables):")
print(score_dataset(drop_X_train, drop_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```
**MAE from Approach 1 (Drop categorical variables): 175703.48185157913**

#### Score from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding)
``` python

from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Make copy to avoid changing original data 
label_X_train = X_train.copy()
label_X_valid = X_valid.copy()

# Apply ordinal encoder to each column with categorical data
ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
label_X_train[object_cols] = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[object_cols])
label_X_valid[object_cols] = ordinal_encoder.transform(X_valid[object_cols])

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(label_X_train, label_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```

**MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding): 165936.40548390493**

#### Score from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding)

We use the OneHotEncoder class from scikit-learn to get one-hot encodings. There are a number of parameters that can be used to customize its behavior.

We set handle_unknown='ignore' to avoid errors when the validation data contains classes that aren't represented in the training data, and
setting sparse=False ensures that the encoded columns are returned as a numpy array (instead of a sparse matrix).
To use the encoder, we supply only the categorical columns that we want to be one-hot encoded. For instance, to encode the training data, we supply X_train[object_cols]. (object_cols in the code cell below is a list of the column names with categorical data, and so X_train[object_cols] contains all of the categorical data in the training set.)

``` python 

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Apply one-hot encoder to each column with categorical data
OH_encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
OH_cols_train = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[object_cols]))
OH_cols_valid = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.transform(X_valid[object_cols]))

# One-hot encoding removed index; put it back
OH_cols_train.index = X_train.index
OH_cols_valid.index = X_valid.index

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
num_X_train = X_train.drop(object_cols, axis=1)
num_X_valid = X_valid.drop(object_cols, axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_X_train = pd.concat([num_X_train, OH_cols_train], axis=1)
OH_X_valid = pd.concat([num_X_valid, OH_cols_valid], axis=1)

# Ensure all columns have string type
OH_X_train.columns = OH_X_train.columns.astype(str)
OH_X_valid.columns = OH_X_valid.columns.astype(str)

print("MAE from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(OH_X_train, OH_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

```


**MAE from Approach 3 (One-Hot Encoding): 166089.4893009678**

### Which approach is best?
In this case, dropping the categorical columns (Approach 1) performed worst, since it had the highest MAE score. As for the other two approaches, since the returned MAE scores are so close in value, there doesn't appear to be any meaningful benefit to one over the other.

In general, one-hot encoding (Approach 3) will typically perform best, and dropping the categorical columns (Approach 1) typically performs worst, but it varies on a case-by-case basis.

### Doing actual practice with categorical variables.

Using [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) dataset.

If you want to see for a certain column if values are the same in training and validation dataset you can do this.

``` python

print("Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data:", X_train['Condition2'].unique())
print("\nUnique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data:", X_valid['Condition2'].unique())

```

- Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data: ['Norm' 'PosA' 'Feedr' 'PosN' 'Artery' 'RRAe']

- Unique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data: ['Norm' 'RRAn' 'RRNn' 'Artery' 'Feedr' 'PosN']

### Problems with this and ordinal encoding

Fitting an ordinal encoder to a column in the training data creates a corresponding integer-valued label for each unique value that appears in the training data. In the case that the validation data contains values that don't also appear in the training data, the encoder will throw an error, because these values won't have an integer assigned to them. Notice that the 'Condition2' column in the validation data contains the values 'RRAn' and 'RRNn', but these don't appear in the training data -- thus, if we try to use an ordinal encoder with scikit-learn, the code will throw an error.

#### Posible solution:

This is a common problem that you'll encounter with real-world data, and there are many approaches to fixing this issue.  For instance, you can write a custom ordinal encoder to deal with new categories.  The simplest approach, however, is to drop the problematic categorical columns.  

Run the code cell below to save the problematic columns to a Python list `bad_label_cols`.  Likewise, columns that can be safely ordinal encoded are stored in `good_label_cols`.

``` python

# Categorical columns in the training data
object_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if X_train[col].dtype == "object"]

# Columns that can be safely ordinal encoded
good_label_cols = [col for col in object_cols if 
                   set(X_valid[col]).issubset(set(X_train[col]))]
        
# Problematic columns that will be dropped from the dataset
bad_label_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(good_label_cols))
        
print('Categorical columns that will be ordinal encoded:', good_label_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', bad_label_cols)

```

- Categorical columns that will be ordinal encoded: ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'LotShape', 'LandContour', 'Utilities', 'LotConfig', 'LandSlope', 'Neighborhood', 'Condition1', 'BldgType', 'HouseStyle', 'RoofStyle', 'Exterior1st', 'Exterior2nd', 'ExterQual', 'ExterCond', 'Foundation', 'Heating', 'HeatingQC', 'CentralAir', 'KitchenQual', 'PavedDrive', 'SaleType', 'SaleCondition']

- Categorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset: ['Functional', 'RoofMatl', 'Condition2']

#### Ordinal encoding

``` python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Drop categorical columns that will not be encoded
label_X_train = X_train.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)
label_X_valid = X_valid.drop(bad_label_cols, axis=1)

# Apply ordinal encoder 
ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
label_X_train[good_label_cols] = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[good_label_cols])
label_X_valid[good_label_cols] = ordinal_encoder.transform(X_valid[good_label_cols])

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding):") 
print(score_dataset(label_X_train, label_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
```

**MAE from Approach 2 (Ordinal Encoding): 17098.01649543379**

#### Get number of unique entries in each column with categorical data

``` python

object_nunique = list(map(lambda col: X_train[col].nunique(), object_cols))
d = dict(zip(object_cols, object_nunique))

# Print number of unique entries by column, in ascending order
sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

```


### What variables can be hot encoded:

With less than 15-10 unique values.

``` python 
# Columns that will be one-hot encoded
low_cardinality_cols = [col for col in object_cols if X_train[col].nunique() < 10]

# Columns that will be dropped from the dataset
high_cardinality_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(low_cardinality_cols))

print('Categorical columns that will be one-hot encoded:', low_cardinality_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', high_cardinality_cols)
```

- Hot encoding:

``` python

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Use as many lines of code as you need!

OH_encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
OH_cols_train = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[low_cardinality_cols]))
OH_cols_valid = pd.DataFrame(OH_encoder.transform(X_valid[low_cardinality_cols]))

# One-hot encoding removed index; put it back
OH_cols_train.index = X_train.index
OH_cols_valid.index = X_valid.index

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
num_X_train = X_train.drop(object_cols, axis=1)
num_X_valid = X_valid.drop(object_cols, axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_X_train = pd.concat([num_X_train, OH_cols_train], axis=1)
OH_X_valid = pd.concat([num_X_valid, OH_cols_valid], axis=1)

# Ensure all columns have string type
OH_X_train.columns = OH_X_train.columns.astype(str)
OH_X_valid.columns = OH_X_valid.columns.astype(str)

```
